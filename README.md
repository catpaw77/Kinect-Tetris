# Kinect-Tetris
Kinect-Tetris is our final project for the course "Introduction to Multimedia Information Systems". We use kinect to keep tracking player body movement. Different positions trigger different functions in tetris game. For example, if the player raise left hand above head, the current block will rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise.
